# 🤖 AUTO-DEPLOY REMINDER

**IMPORTANT**: After making ANY changes to the website, ALWAYS run:

```bash
./auto-deploy.sh
```

OR

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This ensures:
- ✅ Changes are committed to git
- ✅ Changes are pushed to GitHub  
- ✅ Website is built for production
- ✅ Website is deployed to Firebase (https://trackapp-1e6b1.web.app)
- ✅ Both localhost AND online stay updated

**Workflow**: Make changes → Auto-deploy → Changes go live!
